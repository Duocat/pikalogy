Pikachu theme for Terminology
-----------------------------


Terminology is the genius terminal developed by the Enlightenment Foundation (http://web.enlightenment.org/p.php?p=index&l=en)

Terminology can be downloaded from here: http://web.enlightenment.org/p.php?p=about/terminology&l=en

This Edje theme has been inspired from the nyanology theme from Anisse Astier (https://github.com/anisse/nyanology)



Usage
=====

* Make sure terminology is installed (see download link above)
* In the directory of the pikalogy theme
  * `make` to compile the Edje file
  * `sudo make install` to install the files
  * You can override the `PREFIX` variable to change the destination of the installed files
  * `sudo make uninstall` to remove installed files
* In terminology, right-click, select ‘‘Settings’’ then ‘‘Theme’’ and chose ‘‘pikalogy’’
* In Settings/Behaviour don't forget to check the boxes ‘‘React to key presses’’, ‘‘Visual Bell’’ and ‘‘Cursor Blinking’’ for the best effects.
