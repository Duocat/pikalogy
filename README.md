Pikachu theme for Terminology
-----------------------------


Terminology is the genius terminal developed by the Enlightenment Foundation (https://www.enlightenment.org)

Terminology can be downloaded from here: https://www.enlightenment.org/about-terminology

This Edje theme has been inspired from the nyanology theme from Anisse Astier (https://github.com/anisse/nyanology)



Usage
=====

* Make sure terminology is installed (see download link above)
* In the directory of the pikalogy theme:
  * `make DEFINITIONS="your definitions"` to compile the Edje file with options among:
    * `-DWITH_SOUND` to unable sound effects (DISABLED BY DEFAULT)
  * `make install` (as root if necessary) to install the files.
  * You can override the `PREFIX` variable to change the destination of the installed files.
  * `make uninstall` (as root if necessary) to remove installed files.
* In terminology, right-click, select ‘‘Settings’’ then ‘‘Theme’’ and chose ‘‘pikalogy’’
* In Settings/Behaviour don't forget to check the boxes ‘‘React to key presses’’, ‘‘Visual Bell’’ and ‘‘Cursor Blinking’’ for the best effects.
